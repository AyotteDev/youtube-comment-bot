## üéì Educational Purpose

This project is designed to demonstrate:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- YouTube Data API usage
- Python automation techniques
- Proper API credential handling
- Scheduled task execution with cron

It's intended for learning purposes and as a starting point for your own projects.

## ‚ú® Features

- Authenticates using OAuth 2.0 (client_secret.json required)
- Scans your most recent YouTube uploads (configurable number)
- Posts random comments from a customizable template list
- Designed for **personal channels** only (does not spam)
- Built for **macOS**, includes a cron-friendly shell wrapper
- Logs actions to a `/logs` folder

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable the YouTube Data API
- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a project (or reuse an existing one)
- Enable **YouTube Data API v3**

### 2. Create OAuth Credentials
- Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
- Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí choose **OAuth client ID**
- Choose **Desktop App** and download your `client_secret.json` file
- Place it in the root of this project directory

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
```

### 4. First-Time Authentication
```bash
python youtube_comment_bot.py
```

This opens a browser window to grant access to your channel.  
> **IMPORTANT:** Use Google Chrome as your default browser. Safari does not work properly with the OAuth flow.

After approval, it stores `token.json` for future runs.

### 5. Customize Comments
Edit the `comments.txt` file to include your own comments (one per line).

## üîÅ Automation (macOS Cron)

Use the included `run_comment_bot.sh` script. Example crontab entry:
```cron
30 15 * * 1-5 /path/to/youtube-comment-bot/run_comment_bot.sh >> /path/to/youtube-comment-bot/logs/cron_output.log 2>&1
```

> Adjust time as needed. This example runs Mon‚ÄìFri at 3:30 PM.

Not familiar with cron? See the included [cron_guide.md](cron_guide.md) for detailed instructions on setting up scheduled tasks on macOS.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Do **not** share your `client_secret.json` or `token.json`.
- They are ignored via `.gitignore` by default.
- Never push them to GitHub or public storage.
- Be aware of YouTube API quota limitations.
